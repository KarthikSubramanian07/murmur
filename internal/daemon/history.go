// The page's messages from before this daemon started (#138). The daemon exits when idle, and
// the one `mur ui` starts next had read nothing, so the page opened on conversations with their
// beginnings gone. A daemon away for more than catchUpLimit also passes over what was sent
// meanwhile, as history nobody is waiting for, which left a hole in the middle of one.
//
// Both are still in the logs this clone has fetched, so they are read back from there: the newest
// commits across every device's log, up to where this daemon has read each, opened with the keys
// it holds. Nothing more is kept on disk for it, and no request goes to the remote. Keeping the
// page's messages in a file was the other way, and it would not have filled the hole: what a
// daemon passes over, it never reads.
//
// It is read in the background, so neither the daemon's start nor its first sync waits for it, and
// not before a page or a lookup asks: then, and after that whenever a sync has passed over a log's
// backlog, a backlog given up on has been fetched, or this device is given a team key, which opens
// what it couldn't read before.
//
// A session's start and stop are in the same commits, so the Recent view gets those back too. A
// status, a tag or a commit was never on the bus (activity.go), and is gone with the daemon.

// historyDepth is how many commits are read back for each message the page keeps, at most: a log
// holds starts, stops and tags events between its messages.

// Group chats (#184, docs/VISION.md, "Groups"). A group is a tag that starts with group:, its
// members are the sessions that have the tag, and the tag is the group's address. A session joins
// one by setting the tag, as it sets any tag, and leaves by taking it off. An agent can also add
// other sessions to a group, which no other tag allows: the add goes to each session's device as a
// group.add event on the adder's log, and that device makes the tag the session's own.
//
// Nothing holds a group's members but the sessions' tags. A message to a group goes out addressed
// to the tag, and each daemon gives it to those of its sessions that have the tag when it reads the
// message (addressedLocked), so no sender's view of who is in can be out of date.

// maxGroupAdd caps the sessions one call adds to groups: each is an event, and a push.

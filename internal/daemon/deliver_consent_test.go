// Handoff is the one thing the daemon does to the user's other programs, so it stops with the
// user's consent (#55): a clone that hasn't joined, or has left, runs no `t3` and writes to no
// socket. The daemon exits within ConsentPoll of the consent going; these tests make that poll
// long, to show that handoff doesn't rely on it.

// A message that arrives by sync once the user has left waits in the inbox. It isn't handed over, and
// isn't counted as a failure either: when the user joins again, it goes in front of what came after.

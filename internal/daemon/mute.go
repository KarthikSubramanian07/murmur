// Mutes (#27, docs/VISION.md, "Mutes"). A session mutes another by its name, and from then on
// gets nothing the other sends: not a message to it, to its device, or to everyone. Its own device
// decides, by not queueing the message, and publishes the mutes in presence, so they are on the
// bus for anyone on the team to see, a human on the page among them. The muted session isn't
// told when it happens. It learns of it when it next sends to the session that muted it: its own
// daemon, which has read that presence, refuses the send and says why. That is the tool's answer,
// from Murmur and no agent, so it starts no turn anywhere.
//
// Mutes are kept as tags are, by the muting session's name, which stays the same while its
// conversation does, and name the muted session by its name, which the registry never gives out
// twice: a mute can't land on another session.

// Following Claude Code's session ID (#9), and finding the holder of a name (#37).
//
// A Claude Code session's ID changes under it on /clear, /branch and a switch with /resume, and an
// MCP server's copy never does, so the daemon learns the live ID from the hook, which always has
// it, and pairs the hook with its sessions by process: the hook's CLAUDE_PID is the MCP server's
// parent. A session that follows keeps its Murmur ID and its inbox; its key, and so its name,
// change. docs/VISION.md ("When a session stays the same session") has the reasons.

// uniqueKeyLocked is key, unless another live session has it, or has the name it would bring: two
// live sessions of one client session (two MCP servers in it) would share a name, and a name is an
// address, so the later one is a session of its own. The name matters as well as the key because a
// session that finds its T3 thread keeps the name under its old key too (see rekeyLocked), so the
// client's session ID brings the same name, though the session has another key now. Caller holds mu.

// The bus is encrypted (#156): every record with content goes out encrypted for the team key
// (team.go), with nothing for anyone to run, approve or copy. Each device makes its own keys at
// start, publishes the public halves in its sealed presence, and pins its teammates' keys the first
// time it reads them. Push access is the key directory: only collaborators can write refs/murmur/*,
// so only they can publish a key, and only they are granted the team key. docs/VISION.md, "The bus
// is encrypted", has the reasons and what it costs.

// keyPin is what this device knows of a device's keys: the signing key it pinned on first sight,
// the box key that device's latest sealed presence carried, the latest time a sealed presence of it
// was signed with (At, a high-water mark: see newPresenceLocked), and when this daemon last took a
// new one from it, by this machine's clock (Seen, see noteSeenLocked).

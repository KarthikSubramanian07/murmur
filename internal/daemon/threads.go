// T3 threads' own state, read from T3's database, for two things:
//   - the page's "within N minutes" wake setting (#25): a message goes into a thread as a turn only
//     if the thread is busy, or has been idle no longer than that. A thread idle that briefly still
//     has its prompt cache; a turn started after the cache has gone reads the whole conversation
//     again at full price. T3 records when each run of a thread was asked for and when it ended.
//   - settled threads (#189): a thread T3 shows as settled, archived or deleted is offline. It leaves
//     presence, so `who` and the page no longer show it, a message for it is dropped, and `send`
//     refuses one, here and, through presence's Offline list, on other devices. A thread unsettled
//     again (someone typed in it) is back with the next read.
//   - delegates (#188): a thread another thread started (a T3 delegate_task child, a provider's
//     subagent thread) is off the mesh in the same ways, and goes through its parent (Tyler,
//     2026-11-07): it can't send or set a status, and what it commits is credited to the session
//     of its parent thread here, if there is one. A session that wants it messages the parent. It
//     may have taken a name before its thread was read; nobody sees the name.
//
// The database is read every TitleEvery, outside every lock, one query per thread, for the threads
// of the sessions here and of those stopped whose route is kept. What was last read stands while a
// read fails.

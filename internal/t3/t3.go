// Package t3 is t4's way into T3 Code, the app that runs many agent sessions on one machine. A
// session T3 runs is a thread, and T3's own command line, `t3 thread send`, puts a message in one:
// at once if the thread is idle, as its next turn if it is busy, interrupting nothing. A message to
// a thread is how T3's agents talk to each other, and it is how t4 hands a teammate's message to
// the agent it is for (docs/VISION.md, "Delivering a message as a turn").

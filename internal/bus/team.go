// The team key (#156, Tyler's decision of 2026-11-10). Every event and presence is encrypted for one
// X25519 key the whole team shares, so every device that can push, and has published its box key,
// reads everything ever sent: a device that was away reads what it missed, and one that joins later
// reads the history. The key is versioned. An epoch record on the team ref publishes a team public
// key and wraps its private half for devices; a grant record wraps every team private key there has
// been for one device. A new epoch (a rotation) is how a collaborator who has lost push access stops
// reading what is new: the epoch is granted only to devices that publish a presence after it, which
// takes push access. docs/VISION.md, "The bus is encrypted", has the reasons and the costs.

// caller's to end. It is how a daemon that can't be asked to stop is ended (#394): by its process,
// which sends it nothing.
//
// A process ID outlives its process only as a number, and the system gives it to another process
// later. So End never ends by the number alone: it takes hold of the process, looks at what it
// runs, and ends what it holds. On Windows that is a handle, and on Linux a pidfd, which both stay
// with the one process whatever becomes of its ID. macOS has neither, so there the look and the
// signal are two steps by ID, a few microseconds apart.
//
// On Unix the process is sent SIGTERM, which a daemon takes as a stop and shuts down from. Windows
// has no such signal for a process without a window, so it is terminated at once, and what it had
// not finished is lost.
//
// The path is the one the process was started from. A program replaced while it runs keeps its
// process: Linux then reports the path with " (deleted)" after it, and on Windows the installers
// rename the running file aside (mur.exe.old-...), so the path is the renamed one.

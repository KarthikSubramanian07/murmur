// T3 Code can run several accounts of one agent side by side, each a "provider instance" with a
// home of its own: Tyler has a work and a personal Claude Code in T3, the personal one under its own
// CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR (2026-11-01). A session in a home join didn't register in has no Murmur tools,
// so join registers in every home T3's instances use, as well as in the agents' defaults.
//
// T3 keeps the instances in its settings.json (userdata/settings.json in its data directory), under
// providerInstances: an object of instance ID to {driver, displayName, enabled, environment,
// config}, seen on T3 0.1.x, 2026-11-01. Its own code (apps/server, bundled in the app) decides
// which are on and which home each runs in, and the rules below are copied from it:
//
//   - On: off if the instance's `enabled` or its config's `enabled` is false; else whichever of the
//     two is set; else by driver, where cursor, grok, muse, pi, opencode and antigravity default to
//     off and the rest (claudeAgent, codex) to on. A project can override that, which join doesn't
//     read: it registers per user.
//   - Home: config.homePath for claudeAgent (it is a CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR) and codex (a CODEX_HOME),
//     with a leading ~ for the user's home; else the same variable in the instance's environment
//     list; else the agent's default. A codex instance's shadowHomePath is a home that holds only its
//     own auth.json and links the rest, config.toml included, to the shared one, so registering in
//     the shared home covers it.
//   - Binary: config.binaryPath, which is how an agent that isn't on PATH is found (Muse, here).
//
// The file also holds API keys (an instance's environment, a server password), so join decodes
// only the fields above, takes the value of an environment entry only by name and only if T3
// doesn't mark it sensitive, and never prints or logs the file.

// t3Instance is one of T3's provider instances, as much of it as join reads.
